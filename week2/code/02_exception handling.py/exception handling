    result = 10 / num

# Handle the specific case where the user enters zero, causing division by zero
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Print an error message for division by zero
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

# Handle the case where the user input is not a valid integer
except ValueError:
